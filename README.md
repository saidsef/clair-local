# Clair static analysis

Clair is an open source project for the [static analysis] of vulnerabilities in application containers (currently including [appc] and [docker]).

1. In regular intervals, Clair ingests vulnerability metadata from a configured set of sources and stores it in the database.
2. Clients use the Clair API to index their container images; this creates a list of _features_ present in the image and stores them in the database.
3. Clients use the Clair API to query the database for vulnerabilities of a particular image; correlating vulnerabilities and features is done for each request, avoiding the need to rescan images.
4. When updates to vulnerability metadata occur, a notification can be sent to alert systems that a change has occured.

The goal is to enable a more transparent view of the security of container-based infrastructure.
